# Maybot
Source for the Microsoft Bot Framework tutorials.

Warning ;) This code is the scratch evolution of a number of tutorials and bot tips and was never intended to be made public so it is, frankly, a mess. However, some people have requested it so here it is, and now it's here I'll try to be a better citizen and keep it updated. 

The tutorials and tips this code referes to can be found at;

**Note: the configuration files (appsettings.json and Maybot.bot) contain fake references, so please be sure to update to use your service settings**
PS I'm having my own war with github about these settings files, if they are not there at the time you download load then please copy over *Example.bot* and *appsettings.json-Copy*
